                <h2>Web-Development</h2>
                <p>Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites or web applications. It encompasses a range of tasks and disciplines, including front-end development, back-end development, and full-stack development. Front-end development focuses on the user interface and user experience, involving the creation of visually appealing and interactive elements using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Back-end development involves server-side programming, database management, and handling the logic that powers the website or application. Full-stack development combines both front-end and back-end skills, allowing developers to work on all aspects of a project. Web developers use various tools, frameworks, and programming languages such as React, Angular, Node.js, Python, and PHP, depending on the project's requirements. As the internet continues to evolve, web development plays a crucial role in shaping the digital landscape, enabling the creation of dynamic and responsive online experiences.</p>

            <section id="HTML">
                <h2>HTML</h2>
                <p>HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the fundamental building block of web pages. Developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991, HTML serves as the standard markup language for creating and structuring content on the World Wide Web. It uses a system of tags to define different elements within a document, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. The structure of an HTML document is hierarchical, with a root <html> tag containing <head> and <body> sections. The <head> section typically includes metadata, such as the document's title and links to external resources, while the <body> section holds the actual content visible to users. HTML provides a platform-independent and easily readable way to organize and present information on the internet, forming the backbone of web development alongside other technologies like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript. As the core language for web page creation, HTML is continuously evolving, with new specifications and features being developed to enhance the capabilities of the web.</p>
